# Prometheus Stack for Crater

## Overview

Crater relies on the **kube-prometheus-stack** to provide a robust and extensible monitoring solution. It powers real-time and historical observability for:

- Cluster resource usage (CPU, memory, GPU, storage)
- Job lifecycle metrics
- System-level performance indicators
- GPU health and utilization (via DCGM)
- Application-specific custom metrics

### Core Components

- **Prometheus**: Time-series database for metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboard visualization and user-facing metrics panels
- **Alertmanager**: Optional alert routing system (disabled by default)
- **DCGM Exporter**: From `gpu-operator`, exports GPU metrics to Prometheus
- **metrics-server**: Provides Kubernetes resource metrics (CPU, memory)

Crater integrates Grafana dashboards **directly into its frontend**, providing users with multi-dimensional insights without leaving the platform UI.

## Storage Backend

We use **Rook Ceph RBD** as the persistent storage backend for Prometheus.

This ensures:

- High availability and durability of historical metrics
- Block-level performance suitable for large-scale time-series ingestion

> 📌 Make sure `rook-ceph` is correctly installed and the `rook-ceph-rbd` StorageClass is available **before** installing Prometheus stack.

## Dependencies

To fully enable Crater monitoring, please ensure the following components are **installed first**:

| Dependency         | Purpose                                           | Reference                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rook-ceph-rbd`    | Persistent storage backend                        | [docs/rook-ceph.md](./rook-ceph.md)                                       |
| `gpu-operator`     | DCGM Exporter (NVIDIA GPU metrics)                | [docs/gpu-operator.md](./gpu-operator.md)                                 |
| `metrics-server`   | Basic CPU/Memory resource metrics                 | [docs/metrics-server.md](./metrics-server.md)                             |

## Crater Customizations

We provide modified `values.yaml` and subchart configurations for:

- Enabling DCGM metrics scraping
- Preloading a set of Grafana dashboards relevant to Crater workloads
- Setting Grafana service type to `ClusterIP` with Crater-managed ingress
- Configuring Prometheus with a long retention window and custom storage class
- Adjusting image registries and repository paths

Please review and edit these configurations to match your cluster setup, including:

- 🔁 **StorageClass**: Ensure it's set to `rook-ceph-rbd`
- 📦 **Image Repositories**: Match your local/private registry if needed

## Installation

We recommend using the official Helm chart with Crater's preconfigured values.
