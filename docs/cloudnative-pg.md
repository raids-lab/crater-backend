# CloudNativePG for Crater

## Overview

Crater uses **PostgreSQL** as its backend database to manage user sessions, job metadata, scheduling state, and platform configurations.

To achieve production-grade, Kubernetes-native PostgreSQL management, we adopt the [CloudNativePG Operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io/), which provides:

- Declarative management of PostgreSQL clusters via CRDs
- Automated high-availability, backups, and failover
- Tight integration with Kubernetes RBAC, storage, and scheduling

Our deployment integrates CloudNativePG with **OpenEBS Local PV** for storage, enabling fast local-disk performance and complete data lifecycle management.

## Why CloudNativePG?

We chose CloudNativePG because:

- It is a CNCF incubating project with strong community support.
- It provides a clean separation between **PostgreSQL configuration** and **Kubernetes-native orchestration**.
- It simplifies PostgreSQL deployment while remaining flexible for advanced tuning.

In the Crater stack, each PostgreSQL cluster is defined as a custom `Cluster` resource and controlled by the operator.

## Storage Configuration

The database uses local persistent storage backed by OpenEBS Local PV (as described in [`openebs.md`](./openebs.md)).

This setup provides:

- High IOPS and low latency for single-node workloads
- Predictable node-local scheduling
- Clean and declarative volume lifecycle management

Make sure OpenEBS Local PV is installed and functioning correctly before installing CloudNativePG.

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` and `helm` installed
- OpenEBS Local PV installed


## Installation

We provide a tailored Helm configuration for the operator installation.
