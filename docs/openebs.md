# OpenEBS Deployment Guide for Crater

## Overview

Crater relies on **OpenEBS** to manage **local persistent storage** across Kubernetes nodes. Our main goal is to:

- **Enable CRD-based management of local storage resources**, allowing Crater to treat local disks as first-class, declarative resources.
- Use **OpenEBS Local PV HostPath** to provision volumes directly from node-local paths, achieving predictable and efficient data locality.

This setup is ideal for workloads like model serving or intermediate job caching, where:
- Latency to local disk is critical.
- Storage is short-lived but needs proper lifecycle and cleanup.
- Kubernetes-native volume objects are preferred over hostPath mounts.

## Why OpenEBS Local PV?

OpenEBS supports multiple storage engines. We specifically choose the **Local PV** engine for the following reasons:

- No need for external storage infrastructure.
- Works well with node affinity and scheduling constraints.
- Exposes storage usage and lifecycle through Kubernetes CRDs.
- Supports cleanup of volumes automatically when PVCs are deleted.

> ℹ️ Note: In our configuration, we primarily use the `openebs-hostpath` storage class with node-local paths (e.g., `/mnt/local-disks/`), and configure access via `hostPath`.

## Prerequisites

- `kubectl` and `helm` installed
- Node directories pre-created at the local disk mount path (e.g. `/mnt/local-disks/`)

## Installation

We provide a customized Helm configuration for OpenEBS to suit Crater's storage needs.
