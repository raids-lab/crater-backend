# MetalLB for Crater

## Overview

[MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) is a load-balancer implementation for bare-metal Kubernetes clusters. In Crater, it enables **internal service exposure** using **Layer 2 (L2) mode**, which is ideal for environments where nodes reside in the same subnet and can directly communicate—such as campus intranets.

Crater clusters are deployed in a **private university network**, where all nodes and user access points share a common Layer 2 domain. Hence, MetalLB is configured to allocate IPs from a reserved **internal IP address pool**, enabling services of type `LoadBalancer` to be exposed without relying on external cloud providers.

---

## Key Features

- **L2 (ARP/NDP) mode** — simple and effective for intranet environments.
- Assigns **static internal IPs** to Kubernetes services.
- Integrates with services like Prometheus, Grafana, and Harbor.

---

## Installation

MetalLB is installed via the official Helm chart.

### 1. Add Helm Repo

```bash
helm repo add metallb https://metallb.github.io/metallb
helm repo update
```

### 2. Install MetalLB
```bash
helm upgrade --install metallb metallb/metallb -n metallb-system --version v0.14.8 --create-namespace
```

## Configuration
### 1. Create an IPAddressPool
Configure a pool of available intranet IPs that MetalLB can assign to services:
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: intranet-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
    - 192.168.100.240-192.168.100.250  # Replace with your campus subnet range
```

### 2. Configure L2 Advertisement
Enable L2 broadcasting (ARP/NDP) for the IP pool:
```yaml
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: L2Advertisement
metadata:
  name: intranet-l2
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  ipAddressPools:
    - intranet-pool
```

## Usage
Once installed, services of type LoadBalancer will be assigned IPs from the configured pool.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: crater-web
  namespace: crater-system
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: crater-ui
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

MetalLB will automatically assign an IP (e.g. 192.168.100.241) from the defined pool.

You can view assigned IPs with:
```bash
kubectl get services -A -o wide
```

## Best Practices
Reserve address pool in your DHCP server or avoid conflicts manually.

Ensure all cluster nodes are in the same L2 broadcast domain.

Avoid exposing services to the public Internet—MetalLB here is used strictly within the campus network.

* Crater combine with [IngressClass](./ingress.md) for unified domain routing. *
