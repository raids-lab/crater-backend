# Metrics Server for Crater

## Overview

`metrics-server` is a lightweight and scalable resource usage metrics aggregator for Kubernetes. In the Crater platform, it provides **real-time CPU and memory usage data** for:

- Pod and Node resource monitoring
- Job scheduling decisions
- Frontend visualization (e.g., dashboards, usage stats)

Metrics Server is **required** by Kubernetes components such as `kubectl top`, Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA), and Crater's job management UI.

---

## Dependencies

The metrics server must be deployed **after** the Kubernetes cluster is fully operational and can communicate with node components via kubelet.

No external dependencies are required, but make sure:

- The kubelet `--read-only-port` or `--authentication-token-webhook` settings are enabled.
- Your Kubernetes version is compatible with the chosen metrics-server version.

## Crater-Specific Notes

- Crater uses `metrics-server` as part of its **real-time resource display** on the UI.
- Job submission and resource prediction modules may also read these values to improve scheduling accuracy.
- The metrics are complementary to Prometheus but provide faster sampling for short-lived pods.

## Installation

We recommend using the official Helm chart with Crater's values.
